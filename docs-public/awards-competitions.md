## About our Awards and Competitions

Our awards and competitions are designed to incentivise members to help complete sets. 

## Top Gun: Need For Speed (NFS) 2.0

**4-week cycle:**  

* 1 week @ 20k points → **Merlin** = $2m  
* 2 weeks @ 20k points → **Jester** = $2.4m  
* 4 weeks @ 20k points → **Viper** = $3m

**Points:**

* 10k points for 48 hours flying/week
* NFS items give ~0.2 points per flight-minute to obtain

In the weekly Top Gun: NFS awards you are trying to get 20k of those points in a week.  For an example, each camel is worth 38 points. So if you fly 48 hours (10k points) and turn in 264 camels a week, that's your 20k and you will earn an extra $2m minimum.

## Top Gun: Payback

* Earn points based on **lowest 3 stock items**:

  * Lowest → 3 points  
  * Second → 2 points  
  * Third → 1 point

The 1 to 3 per item points is for Top Gun: Payback, which is the every 6 hour lotto you see in ⁠🎁︱awards . These points are used in that lotto every 6 hours then are no longer relevant and don't add up past the period where you earned them.  There isn't currently a way to see how many "tickets" you have other than manually adding them up from the ⁠🧸︱contributions channel in our discord.

## Crew Titles

Your rank, is calculated based on your contribution amount (the flight time to get your item / total amount of flight time to get a set of items (eg a camel is .2351 "contribution sets") and your time in The Club. This then increases the monthly bonus you receive when your items are sold by the Club.

* **Cadet** – default
* **Second Officer** – 90+ days & 1k contribution → 1.01× multiplier
* **First Officer** – 180+ days & 10k contribution → 1.02× multiplier
* **Captain** – 180+ days & 10k contribution and Globetrotter merit → 1.05× multiplier
