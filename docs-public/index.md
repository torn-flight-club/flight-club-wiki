- Prices update every few hours
- Live prices available in Discord #pricelist channel

:::warning Price Updates
Prices change frequently in line with the market
:::

### Contribution System

- **Contribution**: Unit for tracking earnings and work value
- **One Museum Set = One Contribution**
- Items have contribution points based on their price within the set
- Contribution ratio determines leaderboard position and award points
- Ratio calculated as: Item Value / Total Set Value

### Monthly Bonus Structure

**Museum Sets (Plushies/Flowers):**
- Sets exchanged for Museum points
- Points sold for profit
- 50% of profit goes to member bonuses
- Distribution based on contribution ratios

**Example Calculation:**
- Set costs $300k, Wolverine valued at $10k
- Contribution ratio: $10k / $300k = 0.0333
- Club earns $30k profit from set
- $15k (50%) goes to member bonuses
- Wolverine contributor earns: 0.0333 × $15k = $499.50

**Xanax and Other Items:**
- Automatic 50% profit share
- Added to end-of-month bonus

### FIFO System

- First In First Out method for bonus calculation
