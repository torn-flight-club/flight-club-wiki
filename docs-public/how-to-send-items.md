## What items does The Flight Club deal in?

We currently deal with all plushies and flowers that make up Museum Sets, as well as Xanax, and temps (temporary weapons like grenades). You can see the full list of items and the prices paid here: [tornflight.club/items](https://tornflight.club/items)

You will be paid for Plushies, Flowers or other items you send in, at Club Value at the time you send them. 

You don't have to fly for sets, but to help maximise set completion we recommend using /flyme in Discord to see which items are needed due to low stock.

## Who do I send items to?

* Once your registration is completed.
* Send plushies and flowers only to [MIA](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=131289)
* Send Drugs and Other Items (temps etc) only to [GalloInfligo\[2133394\]](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2133394)

## How do I actually send Items?

* No need to set a trade, you can send items anytime you want directly from your inventory.
* Go to your items tab and select the item type you wish to send – temps, drugs, flowers, or plushies

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

## How do I know the items I sent went to the right place?

* The Flight Club system will automatically update and your contribution will be recorded and updated within 5-10 minutes. 
* You can check and see that it updates on your dashboard on our website or in the contributions channel on our discord. 
* After sending items please wait at least 10 minutes before asking for your cash, so the system can catch up.
