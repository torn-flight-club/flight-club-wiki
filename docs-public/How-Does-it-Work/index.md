title: How Does it Work?
---

1. To register for the Flight Club. Please visit [tornflight.club](https://tornflight.club) and enter your PUBLIC API key. Our TOS can be found [here](https://tornflight.club/tos); read it before you access our system. Once you have entered our API key, press login, and you are offically a member of the Flight Club. Also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7MRhvzqAG) and ask a member of management for the TFC role.


2. Do I have to fly for sets?
    - No, you can fly to any location, there are no specific location assignments to anyone.
    - However, **to maximise set completion** we recommend using /flyme in Discord to see which items are needed due to low stock.

3. How to participate:
    - Once your registration is completed.
    - Send plushies and flowers to [MIA[131289]](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=131289) 
    - Send Drugs and Other Items (temps etc) to [GalloInfligo[2133394]](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2133394) 
    > The System will automatically update.
    - No need to set a trade, you can send it anytime you want directly from your inventory.

4. Your contribution will be recorded and updated within 5-10 minutes. You can check and see that it updates on the [dashboard](https://tornflight.club/dashboard) or in the [contributions channel](https://discord.com/channels/886711335088422913/1374235560205488260).

5. You will be paid for Plushies or Flowers you have sent at Club Value. Club Value is calculated from:
    - Market value or protected price that is established in time.
    - Prices are updated every few hours.
    - Market prices are updated daily.

6. Your outstanding payment is shown on the Members Dashboard page or /mystats command. You can request it at any time by using our automated payment request system. Send $1 to any manager, use the payment request button on the website, or use our discord bot using the /requestpay command.

7. You may request your full balance, or a partial balance paymen, (for running Xanax and or requesting cash to buy once you land).

8. The Monthly bonus is calculated from the overall profit that the club achieves at the end of the month:
    - As you send items, your contribution ratio will increase.
    - The Contribution ratio for each item is listed [here](https://tornflight.club/items).
    - The Contribution ratio of each item is calculated from the overall set value total.
    - We use a FIFO method for your bonus, so some months will be better than other months, based on where your items were in the FIFO order.  The previous months bonus will be added to your outstanding bonus at the end of EVERY month.
    - For Xanax and other items, you receive an automatic 50% of the profit the club makes when we sell it.  This is added to your end-of-month bonus.

9. You can check the [Flight Club Dashboard](https://tornflight.club/dashboard) to see: 
    - Current Monthly Bonus for Yourself.
    - Current Outstanding Payments for Yourself.
    - All of your sent items, and contribution points.

10. How can I increase my bonus for my contributions?
    - When travelling, target missing set items to increase the club's set count. This will automatically increase bonuses as the club makes more profit!  Use the Flight Club bot's command /flyme to see the top-paying lowest 3 items in stock.
    - Buy items at less than market price and sell them to club.

11. The [inventory channel](https://discord.com/channels/886711335088422913/1369018518225293514) in Discord shows all items contributed by all members, and also the stock for the club. 

12. We send occasional update Newsletters.

13. With our new system, we no longer require our members to join our discord server, but it is highly recommended because it is where you can access: 
    - Announcements
        - Price Updates
        - Stock Updates
    - Club Chat 
    - Contributions Log (Every contribution is posted live automatically)
    - Access to weekly lotto's

14. Please ensure you follow our [Rules](https://discord.com/channels/886711335088422913/973881070158221392).
