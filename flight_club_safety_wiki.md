# Flight Club - Money Safety Guide

## Overview

Muggings are a part of Torn life, and are especially common in **South Africa**. This guide will help you stay safe when receiving Flight Club payments and managing your money in-game.

## Payment Processing

**Default Behavior**: If you don't put any instruction for management while requesting funds, we will send all your money as soon as we see your request.

## Travel Safety - South Africa

**Important**: If you are heading to South Africa, try and be online when you land as you get a **15 second mug protection** which should give you time to quickly shop and leave town!

## Hospitalization Strategy (60+ Million)

We **strongly recommend** you put yourself in hospital in Torn if we are sending you over **60 million**.

### Methods to Hospitalize Yourself

#### Medical Method (Requires Education)
- **BIO2127 Intravenous Therapy education required**
- Draw some of your blood, then use the wrong blood bag for your blood type

#### Alternative Methods
- Drink **Ipecac syrup** to put you in hospital with a sore tummy
- Ask someone to hospitalise you
- Lose at **Russian Roulette**
- Fail a crime that puts you in hospital

## The "Fake Trade" Protection Method

Once in hospital, you can set up what's called a **"fake trade"** with a buddy:

1. Put your money into the trade
2. Cancel the trade later when you are ready to keep your money safe

**Note**: This is how we managers keep Flight Club money safe when we sell points or items.

## Information Security

### Your Data Protection
We keep your information and requests **very safe** at the Flight Club.

### API Security Recommendations
If you've shared anything other than your **public API** with an old faction or in a tool you found in Torn, it can be a good idea to refresh it and get a new one.
