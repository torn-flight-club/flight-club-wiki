## How are Flight Club prices calculated?

* Flight Club value is calculated from: Torn market values that are updated daily, item market listing prices and bazaar prices.
* Flight Club prices are updated every few hours
* You can watch Flight Club prices live in our discord channel #pricelist

Example only, prices change frequently in line with the market.

## What is a Contribution?

* A *"Contribution"* is a unit we use to keep track of everyone's earnings and the value of their work.
* One "Museum Set" equals one "Contribution." This doesn't mean you have to collect a whole set, in fact that's the advantage of Flight Club, we work together to build sets.
* Each item in a set has a certain number of contribution points based on its price to complete the set.
* Your position on the leaderboard is determined by your total contribution points.
* As you send items, your contribution ratio will increase.

The Contribution ratio for each item is calculated from the overall set value total and is listed here.

## How is my Flushies monthly bonus calculated?

Your Flushies Monthly bonus is calculated from the overall profit that the club achieves at the end of the month.

* Sets are exchanged for points at the Museum.
* Management sells those points for profit.
* 50% of the additional profit goes to Member Monthly Bonuses.

### Bonus Distribution Example

If a set costs $300k and a wolverine is valued at $10k:

* Contribution ratio: 10k / 300k = 0.0333
* If the Club earns $30k profit from the set, then:

  * $15k (50%) → Member bonuses
  * Wolverine contributor earns: 0.0333 * $15k = $499.50

All of these calculations are automated in the system.
You can check your balance and bonus anytime.

## How is my Xanax and other items monthly bonus calculated?

For Xanax and other items, you receive an automatic 50% of the profit the club makes when we sell it. This is added to your end-of-month bonus.

## What does FIFO (First In First Out) mean for my bonus?

We use a FIFO (First In First Out) method for your bonus, so some month's bonus will be better than other month's, based on where your items were in the FIFO order they were sold. Not all items are exchanged/sold in a given month.

Some items will carry over to the next month.

Monthly Bonus is paid to the members that sent in items first. In accounting terms, this is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. If your items remained unsold at the end of the month, your previous months bonus will be added to your next month's outstanding bonus.

## How can I increase my bonus?

Flight Club games, which will be launched again this season, usually reward members for contributing items most needed by the Club to complete sets.

We are also planning to reintroduce dynamic pricing so that you will earn more by contributing most needed items.

You can find out which items are most needed by using the command /flyme in our discord.

You can also watch bazaars and the item market and buy items you see listed at less than market price and sell them to club.
