FAQ

  Won’t I make more money completing flushie sets or selling the items in the item market or my own bazaar?

    Yes, BUT!

      You don’t have to self hosp while selling in your bazaar or on the points market.

      You don’t have to complete the entire flushie set. You can fly/buy only camels,dahlia, etc.

      You don’t have to pay the item market tax to sell items

      Traders pay 5-10% below market price and keep ALL of the profit when they sell.

  This sounds sketchy, how do I know you’re not skimming the money?
