# The Flight Club Charter

## Why does Flight Club exist?

- Our core purpose is to help players earn money.  
- The Club’s second purpose is **FUN!**
- We work together to pool resources and share profits.
- **Member balances and profits are sacred and secure** – we will always be completely open about Club finances and member balances will always be available for payment.

---

## Club Finances – Where Does the Profit Go?

Any profits we make as a Club are split as follows:
- **50%** Member Monthly Bonus  
- **9%** Awards and Competition Prize Budget  
- **20%** Management Salary  
- **20%** Dev Team Salary  
- **1%** ‘Other’ Expenses  
  - e.g. unusual plushie set completion, point sale mug losses, accounting reconciliation, etc.

We also invest in stock benefit blocks when we can:
- **80%** of earnings → Awards & Competition Budget  
- **20%** of earnings → ‘Other’ Expenses Budget  

Stocks can be instantly sold to cover Member balances if needed.

## How Do We Calculate Your Bonuses?

### Flushie Monthly Bonus

- Sets are exchanged for points at the Museum.
- Management sells those points for profit.
- **50%** of the additional profit goes to Member Monthly Bonuses.

#### Bonus Distribution Example

If a set costs **$300k** and a **wolverine** is valued at **$10k**:  
- Contribution ratio: `10k / 300k = 0.0333`
- If the Club earns **$30k** profit from the set, then:
  - `$15k` (50%) → Member bonuses
  - Wolverine contributor earns: `0.0333 * $15k = $499.50`

> All of these calculations are automated in the system.

You can check your balance and bonus anytime.

### All Other Items (e.g. Xanax, Temps)

- No contribution ratio required
- **50%** of the profit margin → Member Monthly Bonus

#### Example

- Member sends 1 Xanax for **$810k**
- Club sells it for **$821k**
- Margin: **$11k**, Bonus: **$5.5k**

---

### First-In, First-Out (FIFO)

The monthly bonus per item is outlined above. However, not all items are exchanged/sold in a given month. Some items will carry over to the next month. Monthly Bonus is paid to the members that sent in items first. In accounting terms, this is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order of operations. 

#### FIFO Example

- **Member A** sends 100 Xanax in January  
- **Member B** sends 100 Xanax later in January  
- Club sells 150 Xanax in January at **$20k** average margin:
  - **Member A**: $20k × 100 = $1,000,000  
  - **Member B**: $20k × 50 = $500,000  
  - Remaining 50 Xanax from Member B will count toward February’s bonus
- Flushie sets follow the same principle. If you want to focus on getting 100% of your bonus without waiting until the next month, focus on NFS items as there will be very little carry-over on those from month to month.

## How Do We Calculate Prices?

### Flushies and Flowers

- **Base price**: 95% of Torn market value  
- Price adjusts based on need:
  - **Most needed item**: 98%
  - **Second most needed**: 97%
  - **3 most common items**: 90%

> You can find out which items are most needed by checking NFS. This can change fast so its good to check before you send in your items.

### Xanax

- Manually set to **98.5%** of market value  
- Auto price drops if market crashes

### All Other Items

Pending more market research and comparison with top traders.
