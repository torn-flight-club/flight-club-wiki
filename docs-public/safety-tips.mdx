### Page 7: Keeping Your Money Safe


Muggings are a part of Torn life, and are especially common in South Africa. This guide will help you stay safe when receiving Flight Club payments and managing your money in-game.

## Avoiding mugs overseas

If you are heading to South Africa to buy Xanax, try and be online when you land as you get a 15 second mug protection which should give you time to quickly shop and leave town! 

Remember you can request the exact amount you need, if you don't request an amount, you will be sent your whole balance.

## Self hosping (hospitalising) Strategy (60+ Million)

We strongly recommend you put yourself in hospital in Torn if we are sending you over 60 million.

Here are some ways to Hospitalize Yourself:
- **Medical Method (Requires Education)**
  - BIO2127 Intravenous Therapy education required
  - Draw some of your blood, then use the wrong blood bag for your blood type
- **Drink Ipecac syrup** to put you in hospital with a sore tummy
- **Ask someone to hospitalise you**
- **Lose at Russian Roulette**
- **Fail a crime** that puts you in hospital

## The "Fake Trade" Protection Method

Once in hospital, you can set up what's called a "ghost trade" with a buddy

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/ghost_trade.png" />
</div>

Put your money into the trade – and don't click accept

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/ghosttrade2.png" />
</div>

Cancel the trade later when you are ready to keep your money safe. Trades stay active for up to 6 hours, so you have plenty of time to prepare to deposit your money somewhere safe. This is how we managers keep Flight Club money safe when we sell points or items.

## Protect your information and data

We keep your information and requests very safe at the Flight Club.

API Security Recommendations - If you've shared anything other than your public API with an old faction or in a tool you found in Torn, it can be a good idea to refresh it and get a new one.  You can do that here, <a href="[destination_url](https://www.torn.com/preferences.php#tab=api)">Torn's API Page</a>


Stay safe out there!
